        <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          This project explores how to produce a "morph" animation between two
          faces. We will also have to compute the mean of a population of faces
          and extrapolate from a population mean to create a caricature of
          myself. I know in the instruction is said to apply your own face to
          someone elses however, when I saw the example picture of George
          Clooney it made me think about how people say my dad has some
          resemblance to him so I thought it would be fun to warp him with
          George Clooney. However, I do apply a warp to myself in the bells and
          whistles section.
        </p>

        <h2 id="Defining-Correspondences">Part 1. Defining Correspondences</h2>
        <p>
          In the first part of this project I manually selected correspondences
          points using the tool given in the instructions between the two input
          images and used Delaunay triangulation to create a triangular mesh.
        </p>

        <h2 id="Mid-way-Face">Part 2. Computing the "Mid-way Face"</h2>
        <p>
          The next portion of this project involved computing the mid-way face
          between my dad and George. After computing the key feature points and
          triangulation, I compute the average points between the two images
          with the equation: avg_pts = (imA_pts + imB_pts) / 2. I then compute
          the Delauney triangulation on the average points. The next step was to
          generate affine transformations between the average points and both my
          dad and George. I then computed the inverse of the affine
          transformation as recommended in our lecture slides, and then apply a
          warping function on each image using its inverse affine matrix. The
          last step is to average the warped images.

        <h2 id="The-Morph-Sequence">Part 3. The Morph Sequence</h2>

        <p>
          For the third part of this project we had to create a morph sequence.
          I used the same method from part 2 to generate the mid-way face with a
          range of weights from [0,1] with 40 frames. I found a library called
          imageio that allowed me to input a list of the morphed images to
          generate a gif. I appended additionally frames of the final frame in
          order to have the image persist.

        <h2 id="Mean-face">Part 4. The "Mean face" of a population</h2>
        <p>
          For the fourth part of this project, I computed the "mean face" of the
          Danes dataset, which consisted of 37 danish people, including 7 women
          and 30 men. This part of the project to quite a bit of time due to
          parsing the data. I began by importing all of the file names from the
          data folder. I then split the files into ".bmp" and ".asf" files which
          corresponds to the photos and their key points. I then created a
          custom parser in order to extract the (x,y) coordinate pairs for the
          key points of each photo. In order to keep things organized, I created
          a dictionary where each key is the path name to a photo and its value
          is the list of key points pertaining to that photo. I then had to
          scale the key points by the height and width of each photo. I then
          computed the average points across all key points in the dictionary in
          order to compute the average shape. Below are four examples of this.

        <p>
          I then computed the average face of all the images in the Danes
          dataset. Below on the left, I took the subsection of female Danes and
          computed the average face, in the middle is the average face among the
          whole dataset, and on the right is the average face of all the Danish
          Men.

        <p>
          Next I took the average Female Dane and warped my face in the average
          females geometry. Overall I do not think I would look good as a Female
          Dane. Below I am showing the aligned version of my original selfie,
          the average female Dane. Then I applied my Geometry to the Female Dane
          and her Geometry to myself.

        <h2 id="Caricatures">
          Part 5. Caricatures: Extrapolating from the mean
        </h2>
        <p>
          For the fifth part of this project I created caricatures of my face
          based on the points of the average female Dane. I was able to slightly
          alter my morph function inorder to account for an alpha variable that
          is used to interpolate the triangles from the Delaunay computation.
          Although in order to create the caricature I had to pick alpha
          variables outside of the standard [0,1] range. What this means is that
          the resulting image would either amplify my face's features (alpha =
          1.5) or amplify the average female face's features (alpha = -0.5).

        <h2 id="Bells-Whistles">Bells and Whistles</h2>

        <p>
          For my bells and whistles I changed my gender of my face using a
          average female asian face from the internet. I aligned the two images
          and applied the various morphing transformations including applying
          only the shape, only the appearance, and both the shape and
          appearance.
